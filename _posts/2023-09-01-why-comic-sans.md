i am dyslexic :3

I think this is a pretty cold take at this point; but, Comic Sans just kinda looks _good_.

## Comic Sans

Occasionally, I'll post a screenshot of my text editor or my web browser...

I often get comments about the number of tabs I have open, or my choice of browser, or whatever.

But, before any of that, without fail, someone will bring up something else:

## Comic Code

I used to juggle a few different fonts, often changing to a new font after using the same one for a while. The popular [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) was one of my favourites for a long time, at least when editing or reading monospaced text. Ligatures usually helped with dyslexia, but I still consistently misread words or strained to read.

Eventually, I found Toshi Omagari's [Comic Code](https://tosche.net/fonts/comic-code), and bought the Ligatures Coding Essentials set on the spot. Now, I exclusively use that font for all monospaced text, and Comic Sans MS for all plain text where possible.

I even use it in my terminal!

Thats all (:

so, like... morally... ethically... if you're not using comic sans youre a sinner :3
